## Routify Webpack Babel example for IE11 support
This sample app doesn't work in IE11 but it works in other latest browsers.

If we remove Routify from this svelte app, it will works in IE11.

## Get started

Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Start local server

```bash
yarn build

yarn dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/myapp/](http://localhost:4200/myapp/). You should see your app running.

This App has two routes
 [http://localhost:4200/myapp/about](http://localhost:4200/myapp/about)

[http://localhost:4200/myapp/faq](http://localhost:4200/myapp/faq)
